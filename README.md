# fitness_tracker_using_python
This Project is Implementation of Smart Fitness Tracker Using Python
# 📊 Smart Fitness Tracker App  

A **machine learning-based fitness tracking application** that allows users to log workouts, track calories burned, and analyze their fitness progress. The app leverages **Random Forest Regressor** to predict calories burned based on workout session details.  

## 🚀 Features  

✔️ **User Authentication** – Secure login and registration system  
✔️ **Personalized Dashboard** – Displays BMI, age, and fitness progress  
✔️ **Workout Logging** – Users can input session details like duration, heart rate, and body temperature  
✔️ **Calorie Prediction** – Uses ML to estimate calories burned per workout  
✔️ **Goal Tracking** – Set daily calorie targets and track achievements  
✔️ **Admin Dashboard** – Manage users, monitor fitness trends, and view analytics  
✔️ **Historical Data Analysis** – View past workouts via graphs and tables
